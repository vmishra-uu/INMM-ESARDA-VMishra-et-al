This repository includes a Jupyter notebook to describe sample shallow and deep learning models used in the analysis. The notebook also goes into the details of the hyperparameters used in the analysis for both, shallow learning models and neural networks for prediction of spent fuel parameters.

It is advisable to run/view the notebook in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). Please ensure all dependencies and the required [dataset](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.dib.2020.106429) is available prior to executing the code. The code is for demonstration only.
